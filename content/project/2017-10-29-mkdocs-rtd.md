[ReadTheDocs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a service that transforms markdown documentation into a neatly formatted webpage. [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is a static site generator that creates documentation webpages.

I use MkDocs extensively but wish the navigation were more compact.

### Project Description

**Goal:** Provide collapsable menu support in a MkDocs theme.

**Requirements:**

* Custom theme based on MkDocs ReadTheDocs theme
