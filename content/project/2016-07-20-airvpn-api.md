As a security precaution (and because my workflow allows), I use IP filtering on my server firewalls. Not having a dedicated IP address at home means I need a way to keep my IP addresses in-sync with my servers.

My workstations are persistently connected to AirVPN which has a poll-able API providing the needed exit IP address.

> Aside: If you need a featureful VPN, I recommend AirVPN. They're an Italian based operation offering the most bang-for-the-buck service of any I've used.

The only piece I was missing was a method for polling and parsing responses from AirVPNs API.

## The Script

In an afternoon I put together [this script](https://github.com/cjsheets/airvpn-utils). It's a fairly basic python CLI application which uses requests to poll and json to parse the
[AirVPN api](https://airvpn.org/faq/api/).

Instructions for use are detailed in the README.md in the repo.

For now I've only added commands to query the information I need. In the future I intend to add commands for the remainder of AirVPNs API.
