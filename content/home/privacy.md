Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 19.Aug.2016

This site, like millions of others, uses [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/). Google helps developers understand how visitors use their site and which pages are most popular.

Google Analytics utilizes "cookies" (small text files stored in your browsers cache) which contain **anonymized** information. This means no personally identifiable information is stored unless you explicitly submit it to the website.

## What type of information is recorded?

Google Analytics stores session information, but not personally identifying information. Examples of session information include:

-   Referring website
-   Length of visit
-   Pages visited
-   Type of web browser used
-   ...and quite a bit more along these lines

## Do you store information about my visit?

The information collected by Google Analytics is sent straight to Google servers and is only accessible to me through reports. Google manages the technical details relating to the gathering and storing of all analytics information.

## What do I do with your data?

Analytics allows me to better understand what content is most popular and how users navigate the site. This helps me make better future design and writing decisions.

All of my activity falls within the bounds of the Google Analytics Terms of Service.

## More information

## Can I opt out of tracking?

Google gives you the option of [opting-out](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) of Googleâ€™s advertising tracking cookies. You can also use a 
[browser plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) to opt out of Google Analytics completely.
