# Hello!

My name is Chad.

I'm a software developer who works at Microsoft. I build solutions for Educators.

## About Me

Originally from Ohio, I currently live in the Seattle area. I studied Electrical Engineering and have a diverse
professional background.

I like software, music, coffee and beer.

Further elaboration about me (in all its boring detail) is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadsheets)

## About sheets.ch

I enjoy learning and contributing to open source projects. This site is a convenient place
to collect notes for my future, forgetful self.

I also thought it would be neat ot own Swiss property in the form of this TLD. For only
$15/year, I get to be available at sheets.ch/ad :-)
