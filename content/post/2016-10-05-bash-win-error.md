I've been testing the limits of the new Ubuntu/Bash shell on Windows and after restarting my computer it mysteriously refused to launch. Running `bash` from the command line yielded the following message:

```bash
Error: 0x80070002  
```

After a few attempts at repair I resorted to re-installing by issuing the following commands from the command line:

```
lxrun /uninstall /full
lxrun /install  
```

This reset the environment and deleted everything I'd done, but seemed to be the only option.

Back to square one.
