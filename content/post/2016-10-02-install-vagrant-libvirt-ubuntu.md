Vagrant could be installed using the Ubuntu package manager: `apt-get install vagrant` It's strongly recommended, however, to download the
[latest version](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) from their site and install it manually. Choose 32 or 64 bit \*.deb, download, and install with the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i vagrant_*.deb  
```

## Vagrant + libvirt

Vagrant supports virtualbox, VMware and AWS out of the box and is easily extended to support more like libvirt or LXC on Ubuntu.

For use with libvirt, see the [official plugin page](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt) on GitHub for detailed instructions.

I installed the following prerequisites prior to installing the libvirt plugin:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libvirt-dev zlib1g-dev ruby-dev  
```

Once the dependencies were installed I setup the libvirt plugin using the following command:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt  
```

Using Vagrant

A sample Vagrantfile input is shown below.

```bash
    # -*- mode: ruby -*-  
    # vi: set ft=ruby :
     
    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|  
      config.vm.box = "debian/jessie64"
      config.vm.provider :libvirt do |libvirt|
        libvirt.storage_pool_name = "VagrantPool"
      end
    end  
```

Finally, launch vagrant with the following:

```bash
vagrant init debian/jessie64; vagrant up --provider libvirt  
```

## Extending Available Boxes with Mutate

[vagrant-mutate](https://github.com/sciurus/vagrant-mutate) converts vagrant boxes built for other virtualization systems to libvirt.

First, we need to setup our environment with the required dependencies:

```bash
apt-get install qemu-utils libvirt-dev ruby-dev  
```

vagrant-mutate is installed as a plugin.

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-mutate  
```

Finally, convert boxes with the following command:

```bash
vagrant mutate https://atlas.hashicorp.com/debian/boxes/wheezy64/versions/7.11.2/providers/virtualbox.box libvirt  
```
